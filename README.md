GoldenLab — An interactive web app (PWA) that teaches the Golden Ratio, lets students measure and annotate photos (sunflowers, ear, face), runs phyllotaxis simulations, computes packing metrics, creates exportable PDF experiment reports, and provides a full-screen presentation (kiosk) mode for judges.
